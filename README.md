Random Emoji Generator 
A minimalistic web app that displays a random emoji whenever you click a button—no frameworks, no fuss.

What I Learned
Emojis can be treated as JavaScript strings and displayed with innerHTML or String.fromCodePoint() for dynamic output.
Randomization using Math.random() and array access (emojis[index]) ensures a new emoji each click.
Learned to cleanly manipulate the DOM by binding click events to buttons—basic but core for interactive web interfaces.

Favorite Feature
I enjoyed rendering a random emoji on button click. It’s fun, visually interesting, and instantly engaging—very satisfying to click and see a new emoji appear.

Next Enhancements
Integrate an API-based emoji fetcher (e.g. Emoji API) for a broader set and randomness.
Let users copy the displayed emoji by clicking on it.
Add a dropdown or filter by emoji categories (nature, faces, food, etc.).
